## Hello! I'm Thalia - showcasing personal projects I have worked on as an undergraduate student.

Over the past year, I have contributed to a program developed by faculty members in UTRGV's math department. My role in the project was translating existing Fortran code to C++ and Python. Learning about parallel programming encouraged me to form a team of computer science students. We are currently co-advised by the math and computer science departments.

### **Data Visualization & Intelligence Analysis of “San Valero” Traffic Fatalities**
*The University of Texas at San Antonio* | *August 2020*

Quarantine gave me the opportunity to virtually attend UTSA's Data Science National Security Summer Camp. This camp was made possible with sponsorship from the Defense Intelligence Agency. Using close mentoring by data scientists in the national security sector and experimental learning to facilitate the use of data analytics while role-playing positions analogous to intelligence analysts, my team and I presented our data-driven findings to a real-world problem using Tableau.

### **Community Involvement**

* Association of Computing Machinery Student Member: I have volunteered at local community events, including the local annual High School Programming Contest and <a href="https://www.utrgv.edu/hestec/" target="_blank">HESTEC</a>. For workshops and networking, I attended hackathon events held at various universities (CodeRED and HackTX).
