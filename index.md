## About

I'm a Computer Science student (read: unemployed) from Texas. My interests lie in backend development and data analytics. If I am not working or doing homework, I am reading or playing games. 

Thoughts and tech-related ramblings can be found [here].

### High Performance Computations for Random Network Models of Parental Vaccine Acceptance and Disease Spread using CuPy - In Progress

* Over the past year, I have contributed to a program developed by a team of UTRGV students and faculty for a math research course and senior project. Translating existing Fortran code to Python and C++ in parallel, compelled me to recruit a team of computer science students to continue the research. The current senior project goal is to make the program run on multiple GPUs as efficiently as possible.

### Data Visualization & Intelligence Analysis of “San Valero” Traffic Fatalities - Summer 2020

* Quarantine gave me the opportunity to virtually attend UTSA's Data Science National Security Summer Camp. This camp was made possible with sponsorship from the Defense Intelligence Agency. Using close mentoring by data scientists in the national security sector and experimental learning to facilitate the use of data analytics while role-playing positions analogous to intelligence analysts, my team and I presented a solution to a real-world problem using Tableau.

### Community Involvement

* As an Association of Computing Machinery member at school, I volunteered at local community events, including the local annual High School Programming Contest and [HESTEC](https://www.utrgv.edu/hestec/). For workshops and networking (CodeRED and HackTX), I attended hackathon events held at various universities.
