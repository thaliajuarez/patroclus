	<h1>Hello friend, I'm Thal√≠a!</h1>
	<p>My favorite book is <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Jane Austen. I did not know how to introduce myself so I took a personality test for you and I was described as an INTP-T personality. It stands for introverted, intuitive, of a thinking nature rather than of a feeling one, I approach work in a prospecting rather than a judging manner, and the way I identify myself is more turbulent than assertive. This site is a way for me to track the happenings in my life as objectively as possible. Rather than attempting to dissect each moment through thought-provoking reflections, I will set up a timeline or charts. Meme garbage, if you will. The goal is to feel better at the end of the day. There is a lot to unpack so welcome! For a quick overview read more in the <a href="/about"> about page...</a></p>
