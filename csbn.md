#### **About the project**

This program simulates an epidemic based on the probability that a household will vaccinate their children. We generate two overlapping networks, the parents and the children, in parallel on multiple NVIDIA GPUs. The program was developed by faculty members, Dr. Tamer Oraby and Dr. Andras Balogh, from UTRGV's math department. Last December, I recruited a team of two other CS students and one other computer science faculty member (Co-Advisor Dr. Marzieh Ayati) to improve the program. It is now a senior project co-advised by two departments. We have benefited from the multitude of skills on the team.
