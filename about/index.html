<h1>About</h1>
<p>My favorite book is <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Jane Austen. </p>
<p> Twenty years old. </p>
<p>I did not know how to introduce myself so I took a personality test for you and I was described as an INTP-T personality. It stands for introverted, intuitive, of a thinking nature rather than of a feeling one, I approach work in a prospecting rather than a judging manner, and the way I identify myself is more turbulent than assertive.</p>
