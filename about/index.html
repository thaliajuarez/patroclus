<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    To learn a little bit more about web development, I created this static site with 
    <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll</a> 
    and a mock site for the <a href="/sps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Society of Physics Students - Edinburg</u></a>, aka SPS.
